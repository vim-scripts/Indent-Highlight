This plugin provides a function that will highlight (or remove
highlighting ) of the current scope and parent scope based on difference in
indentation. It can be very usefull for languages that use indentation to
define the scope ( python, rubby, etc. )

I wrote this script so that I could quickly restore visual stack when
coding in python. So for python I created the following mapping in my vimrc:

map <silent> <Leader>ih :call IHighlight( 1, "\^[[:space:]]*\\(def\\\\|class\\)[[:space:]]\\+" )<CR> 
map <silent> <Leader>is :call IHighlight( 0, "\^[[:space:]]*\\(def\\\\|class\\)[[:space:]]\\+" )<CR>

which allows me by entering \ih (or \is) to highlihgt current scope along
with the parent scope and than by entering \ih (or \is) again remove the
highlighting

the difference between \ih and \is is that
the first one (\ih) will turn off all syntax highlighting untill indentation highlighting is active
the syntax highlighting will be turned back on when you enter \ih again turning the indentation highlighting off
the second one (\is) will apply indentation highlighting on top of existing syntax highlighting

one can extend this functionality and provide bindings for movement keys so
that highlighting follows the cursor position
